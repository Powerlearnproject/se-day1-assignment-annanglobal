#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of conceptualizing, ideating, developing, deploying, and maintaining software that is very usable in human society. 
The importance of software engineering cannot be overstated. It helps human society in achiveing bigger targets in a fraction of the time required. Hence it amplifies our capabilities. Secondly, the software engineering process helps fine tune the development in technology such that there is a good fit betweeen the products of software engineering and solutions to the needs of human society. This enhances efficiency and performance in the technology industry. In so doing, softwares are created that power aspects of modern life such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare. 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
2. The Waterfall Model or structured programminig (1970s)
3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (1990s-2000s)

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Below is a list and explnation of The Software Development Life Cycle:
  - Requirements: Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface. Akin to creating the achitectural plan for the software product
  - Implementation: This involves the actual writing of code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: After the software is created, it needs to be tested to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: When we are able to establish that some minimum requirements are met, and that the software product is effective in solving the problem for which it was created to solve, then it is time to release it to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: After the software is releasedm, it needs maintenance just like any important system.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall approach follows a sequential approach with distinct phases whiles the agile methodology follows an itirative approach whiles encouraging collaboration and flexibility.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Within the team, the software developer is responsible for writing code and building the actual software solution. The quality assurance engineer is responsible for building and maintaining systems aimed at ensuring the software product and process meet the required standards including regulatory compliance if any. The project manager is in charge of the overall software development process and hence coordinates all the roles and activities to achieve a coherent process and an optimal outcome in the whole software development process.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples include Visual Studio. Version Control are effective tools that help in collaborative teams in the software development process. It helps in tracking changes to the original code and help coordinate work among the software development team.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements as development is going on may lead to delays in delivery, and scope creep. Tight deadlines may imped the creation of robust softwares which are sustainable.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing the viability of individual components of the software to ensure that portion is is working as expected. Integrapion systems involves working with interacting components of the software, system testing involves validating if the entire software is working as expected as a whole unit, whiles acceptance testing involves having the needs and acceptance of the end user in mind, thereby going out to find out if the software meets the requirements of the user.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves the series of precise instructions that one can give a software system so as to enable the software perform a desired task, just like how you might instruct a subordinate of yours to go out and perform a certain desired action. Artificial Intelligence, is all about creating systems that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. Without prompt engineering, we cannot get the best our of the AI models available.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example about vague prompt: "Tell me about dogs".
An example of a clear specific prompt: "Tell me about pit bulls and why they have the reputation as dangerous dogs". The first prompt requests a broad and vague idea about dogs in general, whiles the second prompt makes a more precise request about pitbulls who are known to be ferocious dogs.
